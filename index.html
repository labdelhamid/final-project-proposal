    <h1>HowTrueAreYou - Lama Abdelhamid</h1>
	<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
    <h3>Application Overview: I will create a game similar to what we did in matchmaker through python that will determine
         how good you are at determining which of the given statements are true or false based on the game's standards. 
         The possible responses to the statements will be true, false, or neither. After the game is played, an overall score 
         value will be assigned to the player based on how well they did and how they responded to the statements.</h3>
    
    <h3>Technology Overview: I will mostly be using python in order to execute the application, but the final project Proposal
        will be hosted through azure.</h3>
